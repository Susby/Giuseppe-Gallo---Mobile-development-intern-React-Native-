Dear Ignacio,
I uploaded here my technical test. I worked on App.js file.
Unfortunately, I coded just one square and I wanted to do better also for other but I couldnâ€™t start the test in the next days after the interview. Moreover, I had to study React Native because I never used it.
However, I really enjoyed doing the test.
I look forward to hearing back from you.

Kind regards,
Giuseppe Gallo
